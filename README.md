# Hi, I'm Annie 👋

_Systems engineer, Rustacean, and infrastructure nerd_

I'm currently at [Caltech/IPAC](https://www.ipac.caltech.edu/), where I build and maintain scalable infrastructure for astronomical data—working at the intersection of science, systems, and software. Most of my open source work lives in the space between low-level control and high-level orchestration.

### 🔧 What I work on

- 🛰️ Distributed systems & storage (Ceph, ZFS, Kubernetes, observability stacks)
- 🦀 Embedded Rust — currently writing [`ask433`](https://github.com/yourusername/ask433), a `#[no_std]` RF driver
- 🧮 Scripting languages and DSLs — like [Xod](https://github.com/yourusername/xod), a tiny REPL for bitwise math
- 📊 Privacy-respecting telemetry, logging, and reproducibility tooling

### 🧠 Philosophy

> “I care about elegant abstractions, reproducible science, and building the systems we’ll need to survive the ones we didn’t.”

I believe in open tools for shared liberation. That means code should be legible, maintainable, and respectful of both users and contributors.

_Thanks for stopping by! If you’re working on something weird, resilient, or Rusty—I’d love to hear about it._
